00:00:00.493 --> 00:00:04.483
If you just have your cursor on a line, hit Control C and Control V, it'll copy that line.

2
00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:08.443
You can also use Control X to delete an entire line.

3
00:00:08.443 --> 00:09:00.433
A similar way to do something like this would be the alt button plus the arrow keys, that allows you to move lines up and down, or alt plus shift and the arrow keys, and that allows you to duplicate lines up and down.

4
00:09:883 --> 00:18:703
You can also use alt plus mouse click in order to select multiple lines and then you can make changes on all those lines at once.

5
00:25:773 --> 00:39:463
Another of my favorite shortcuts is Control D. If you just have your cursor inside of a word, hit Control D, it's going to highlight that word, and another use for this is if you have anything highlighted, you click Control D, it's going to highlight the next thing that has that same text, and you can continue to do that over and over again,

6
00:39:463 --> 00:42:553
which is great if you need to rename a variable in a small scope.

7
00:42:863 --> 00:47:633
Now, the Control P command allows you to search for files and open them up, so we can switch between our files.

8
00:47:803 --> 00:52:83
Control Shift P allows you to run different commands from VS code, so I can open up my settings, for example.

9
00:53:193 --> 00:59:903
And finally, you can hit Control plus the forward slash key, and that allows you to comment out a line, or if you highlight a bunch of code, you can comment it all out at once.`;

    const result = parseVTT(vttContent);
    // For debugging: print errors and cues if the test fails
    if (result.errors) {

    }
    expect(result.errors).toBeUndefined();
    expect(result.cues).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.cues.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

If you just have your cursor on a line, hit control C and control V, it'll copy that line.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:07:550
