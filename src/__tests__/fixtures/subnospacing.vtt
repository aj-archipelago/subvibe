00:00:00.424 --> 00:00:01.464
The end of programming
2
00:00:01.464 --> 00:00:02.744
as we know it.
3
00:00:03.354 --> 00:00:04.864
We got an we got ourselves
4
00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:05.314
an O'Reilly article.
5
00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:10.044
I went and checked the length of this and if this is new, it is new.
6
00:00:10.044 --> 00:00:11.994
And so, here we go.
7
00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:15.044
We're doing this the end of programming
8
00:00:15.044 --> 00:00:15.674
as we know it.
9
00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:21.304
Yet again another faithful article to the current state of the times.
10
00:00:21.304 --> 00:00:25.114
This time by O'Reilly, who makes their money off of selling
11
00:00:25.114 --> 00:00:28.084
programming books has written an article
12
00:00:28.084 --> 00:00:28.784
called the end of programming
13
00:00:28.784 --> 00:00:30.004
as we know it.
14
00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:32.264
This is going to be great.
15
00:00:32.264 --> 00:00:34.954
I mean, I'm not sure what O'Reilly's trying to do here,
16
00:00:35.094 --> 00:00:39.344
but it kind of seems counterintuitive.
17
00:00:39.344 --> 00:00:42.194
And this is by Timothy O'Reilly.
18
00:00:42.404 --> 00:00:47.004
Like this guy, this is Timothy O'Reilly, like Timotheus O'Reilly.
19
00:00:47.004 --> 00:00:47.974
All right, there's a lot of chatter
20
00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:56.274
in media that software developers will soon lose their jobs to AI, I don't buy it.
21
00:00:56.274 --> 00:00:59.674
Oh my gosh.
22
00:00:59.674 --> 01:03.364
Wait a second, did I just get jabaited by this article
23
01:03.364 --> 01:04.724
and are we about to get hit with some
24
01:04.724 --> 01:10.024
straight facts from O'Reilly software.
25
01:09.994 --> 01:10.914
It is not the end of programming.
26
01:10.914 --> 01:16.164
It is the end of programming as we know it today.
27
01:16.164 --> 01:16.754
That is not new.
28
01:16.754 --> 01:22.084
The first programmers connected physical circuits to perform each calculation.
29
01:22.084 --> 01:26.044
They were succeeded by programmers writing machine instructions.
30
01:26.044 --> 01:34.064
They were succeeded by programmers writing machine instructions as binary code to be input one bit at a time by flipping
31
01:34.064 --> 01:34.954
switches on the front of a computer.
32
01:34.954 --> 01:44.274
Assembly language programming then put an end to that it lets a programmer use a human like language to tell the
33
01:44.274 --> 01:47.134
computer to move data to locations in memory.
34
01:47.134 --> 01:48.224
This is true.
35
01:48.224 --> 01:53.994
If you did not know how crazy you got to read uh Uncle Bob has that whole history of programmers.
36
01:53.994 --> 01:59.854
We programmer wrote the forward.
37
01:59.854 --> 02:02.164
Hell yeah, I get nothing for saying that.
38
02:02.164 --> 02:06.164
But it's actually a pretty sweet book.
39
02:06.164 --> 02:11.534
Uh I read through it, it's great.
40
02:11.534 --> 02:15.854
Uh, there's a lot of chatter in media that software developers
41
02:15.854 --> 02:20.654
will soon lose their jobs to AI, I don't buy it.
42
02:20.654 --> 02:20.994
Oh my gosh.
43
02:20.994 --> 02:22.254
Wait a second.
44
02:22.254 --> 02:24.884
Did I just get jabaited by this article?
45
02:24.884 --> 02:26.464
And are we about to get hit with some
46
02:26.464 --> 02:29.204
straight facts from O'Reilly software.
47
02:29.454 --> 02:37.694
Timotheus O'Reilly is actually based.
48
02:37.694 --> 02:40.874
It is not the end of programming.
49
02:40.874 --> 02:43.094
It is the end of programming as we know it today.
50
02:43.094 --> 02:45.044
That is not new.
51
02:45.044 --> 02:53.724
Oh, okay, actually, no, this is not based.
52
02:53.724 --> 02:55.964
The first programmers connected physical circuits
53
02:55.964 --> 03:00.714
to perform each calculation.
54
03:00.714 --> 03:03.644
This is true, if you did not know how crazy
55
03:03.644 --> 03:09.164
you got to read uh Uncle Bob has that whole history of programmers.
56
03:09.164 --> 03:11.234
We programmer wrote the forward.
57
03:11.454 --> 03:17.284
Hell yeah, I get nothing for saying that, but it's actually a pretty sweet book.
58
03:17.284 --> 03:25.324
Uh, I read through it, it's great.
59
03:25.324 --> 03:34.624
Uh, this is not new.
60
03:34.624 --> 03:42.354
All right, uh they were succeeded by programmers writing machine instructions as binary code to be input one bit at a time by flipping
61
03:42.354 --> 03:44.414
switches on the front of a computer.
62
03:44.694 --> 03:50.374
Yes.
63
03:50.374 --> 03:51.214
I love that people are actually
64
03:51.214 --> 03:53.384
attempting to co uhh.
65
03:53.384 --> 03:54.504
Do are you actually
66
03:54.504 --> 03:57.134
trying to are you actually trying
67
03:57.134 --> 04:06.174
to correct my pronunciation of O'Reilly.
68
04:06.174 --> 04:12.154
Dude, it's way more funny to call it O'Reilly.
69
04:12.154 --> 04:14.854
Then it is to call it O'Reilly.
70
04:14.854 --> 04:16.174
All right, there's a lot of chatter in media
71
04:16.174 --> 04:24.874
that software developers will soon lose their jobs to AI, I don't buy it.
72
04:24.874 --> 04:28.334
Oh my gosh.
73
04:28.334 --> 04:29.994
Wait a second.
74
04:29.994 --> 04:32.164
Did I just get jabaited by this article?
75
04:32.164 --> 04:33.804
And are we about to get hit with some
76
04:33.804 --> 04:35.774
straight facts from O'Reilly software.
77
04:35.774 --> 04:37.814
Timotheus O'Reilly is actually based.
78
04:38.264 --> 04:47.224
It is not the end of programming.
79
04:47.224 --> 04:57.494
It is the end of programming as we know it today, that is not new.
80
04:57.494 --> 05:08.624
Oh okay, actually, no, this is not based.
81
05:08.624 --> 05:35.334
The first programmers connected physical circuits to perform each calculation.
82
05:35.334 --> 05:56.024
This is true, Seymour Cray hand flipped in an operating system from memory on the Cray One if I'm not mistaken.
83
05:56.024 --> 05:57.884
Pretty fantastic.
84
05:57.884 --> 06:00.094
I love that people are actually attempting
85
06:00.094 --> 06:02.124
to co uh do.
86
06:02.124 --> 06:02.534
Are you actually
87
06:02.534 --> 06:05.154
trying to are you actually trying
88
06:05.154 --> 06:06.724
to correct my pronunciation
89
06:06.724 --> 06:09.224
of O'Reilly.
90
06:09.224 --> 06:13.404
Dude, it's way more funny to call it O'Reilly.
91
06:13.404 --> 06:15.334
Then it is to call it O'Reilly.
92
06:15.634 --> 06:15.904
Shut up.
93
06:15.904 --> 06:18.394
They were succeeded by programmers writing
94
06:18.394 --> 06:22.464
machine instructions as binary code to be input one bit at a time.
95
06:22.464 --> 06:26.714
By flipping switches on the front of a computer.
96
06:26.714 --> 06:30.374
Assembly language programming then put an end to that.
97
06:30.374 --> 06:40.654
It lets a programmer use a human-like language to tell the computer to move data to locations in memory and perform calculations on it.
98
06:40.654 --> 06:41.984
Then, development of even higher
99
06:41.984 --> 06:47.344
level compiled languages like Fortran, COBOL.
100
06:47.344 --> 06:52.244
 Uh to be completely fair.
101
06:52.634 --> 07:05.514
Fortran, it didn't actually happen this way.
102
07:05.514 --> 07:17.674
Fortran was actually uh 1958, which is just the very beginning of machine languages.
103
07:17.674 --> 07:21.524
I believe you still have to feed things in by tape and all that kind of crazy stuff.
104
07:21.524 --> 07:25.124
That's like why there's like a seven uh column requirement
105
07:25.124 --> 07:27.544
in Fortran on the early Fortran code.
106
07:27.544 --> 07:30.104
I know it's I'm just saying, Fortran was written
107
07:30.104 --> 07:33.414
because there's this whole idea that compilers actually
108
07:33.414 --> 07:36.954
aren't efficient, and so if you want efficiency, you
109
07:36.954 --> 07:39.574
have to handwrite all of your own machine instructions.
110
07:39.574 --> 07:42.874
Uh, and remember, you got to remember like back then,
111
07:42.874 --> 07:51.824
it was like a kilohertz was like a like, dude, I'd kill a hurt too.
